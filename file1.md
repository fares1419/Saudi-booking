## Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in investigating a Booking.com in Saudi Arabia dataset found on Kaggle containing 1389 rows that has been scraping from booking websites in KSA to answer these questions:

Which cities have the most bookings in Saudi Arabia?
What is related to price?
What is the difference between facilities in high-price hotels and low-price hotels?
